# partyquest
A demo cutscene system for the PICO-8 fantasy console, including handcrafted sprite and animation systems. Last updated in 2020, uploaded in 2022 for archival purposes.

File explanation:
* party_new.p8 - a PICO-8 cartridge implementing loading dialogue scripts from an external "databank" cart
* d_bank_1.p8 - a cartridge acting as a data store for dialogue scripts, including a test script
* party_orig_say.p8 - same as party_new.p8 but storing dialogue scripts internal to the cart, including a more significant sample script
